# Pizza-based Vue.js demo

This is a basic Vue.js demo that is based upon [https://codepen.io/steinbring/pen/LYyPjmM](https://codepen.io/steinbring/pen/LYyPjmM) but uses the [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/).  It is meant to show basics of binding, watchers, computed properties, and how to include a library ([Buefy](https://buefy.org/)) to a vue-cli app.

Demo Site: [https://vue-demo.jws.app/](https://vue-demo.jws.app/)

Note: The demo site is driven by the main branch, using [render](https://render.com).  Updates to the main branch trigger the build command ```yarn build```.
